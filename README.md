# Introduction

The semantic retrieval signature described in "Organizational principles of semantic retrieval in the human cortex" is stored in this repository.

Through the integration of computational linguistics with machine learning, this study identified a robust and generalizable semantic retrieval signature that is sensitive to word-pair semantic distance variations, where larger semantic distances correspond to increased controlled retrieval demands. This signature is specific to semantic processing rather than general executive control.

# Materials

## 1. A precise whole-brain topography of semantic retrieval demands

The whole-brain semantic retrieval signature in CIFTI and NIFTI formats can be accessed in the "Semantic Retrieval Signature" folder. The stimulus materials used to construct this neural signature can be found in the "Word-pair Stimulus" folder.

## 2. The prediction of trial-level semantic distances and reaction times by the semantic retrieval signature

The trial-level beta maps used to validate the accuracy of the semantic retrieval signature (corresponding to each word pair) can be found in the "Word-pair Beta Maps" folder. These beta maps (available in both CIFTI and NIFTI formats) can also serve as benchmarkers for testing other related neural signatures.

## 3. Decomposition of semantic retrieval signature into distinct cognitive systems

Information on the core brain regions (ROIs) within the semantic retrieval signature can be found in the "ROIs" folder. This folder contains both surface and volume versions of the ROI data, along with the corresponding functional system indices.
